There’s something laid back, sure-handed about the way Westside Boogie raps. He sits in the pocket with a knowing smirk and tells you how he sees it, good or bad. Throughout "More Black Superheroes", Boogie grapples with his insecurities, reflects on his “toxic” behavior in past relationships, and acknowledges his need to grow, all while sounding self-assured. He’s aware, he’s working on it, no use stressing. The production on the album is understated, leaving plenty of room for Boogie’s unique voice to drive the songs. This is as it should be - his ability to flow from melody to bars to catchy hooks keep his songs effortlessly interesting. This album was a head-bumping good time on first pass, with depth that I continued to find in each successive listen.
