Black Thought (lead MC of The Roots since their 1993 debut) and Danger Mouse (superproducer of the Grey Album, Gnarls Barkley and Broken Bells fame) deliver an inspired love letter to fans of the "golden age" of rap, which pays homage to and in some instances transcends the classic beats and rhymes of that era.  The production is soulful with unexpected twists and turns - Danger Mouse has meandered away from hip-hop in recent years, but has clearly kept the genre close to his heart with such a stellar set of tracks. Black Thought continues to age gracefully and seems to somehow get better with time.  He sprinkles hard-won philosophical jewels and birds eye view social commentary among technically excellent flows of battle rap fare.  Golden Age veterans Raekwon, MF Doom (posthumously) and Run the Jewels provide timely features. Shortlist for best hip hop album of the year.
