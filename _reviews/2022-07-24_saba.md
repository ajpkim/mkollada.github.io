Don’t let the varying, often surprisingly playful, flows fool you, Few Good Things finds Saba exploring similar themes of trauma and grief as its predecessor, albeit arising out of different circumstances. His storytelling prowess overlays a wide array of beats spanning subdued jazzy songs (ex. Come My Way, 2012) to trap leaning cuts (ex. Survivor’s Guilt, Stop That). Don’t make the same mistake Matt Kollada made (I had to bring it up Kookis, my apologies) and sleep on Saba. Too many are still doing so and he’s issued his warning: "Stop that. Stop it please" - Zack
