<br>
It's been a hectic, exciting August for me. I've road tripped from Chicago to NYC, officiated a wedding, and am in the process of moving into a new apartment in Brooklyn today. Fortunately I've had some great music, a lot of it from y'all, with which I could celebrate, decompress, carry overpacked boxes, and stare down long Ohio highways. Now I get to share some of that music with you, and that makes me happy.<br>
<br>
For August we’ve got:</span>

<ul>
	<li style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><span style="font-size:12px">A <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/71iEeYH7jUVjpMLsJoO9UA?si=4ddba0cd3d67462f" target="_blank" style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #007C89;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">Spotify playlist</a> of songs I’ve been digging&nbsp;this month</span>

	<ul>
		<li style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><span style="font-size:12px">It’s collaborative!&nbsp;Add something you’ve had on&nbsp;repeat this month</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><span style="font-size:12px">Three fantastic albums I was listening to&nbsp;in August&nbsp;</span></li>
	<li style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><span style="font-size:12px">Recently married (by me) man, Ryan Tooley, sent me an album earlier&nbsp;this month and I invited him to share it here. I’m always pumped to get music from him and this was no exception</span></li>
	<li style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><span style="font-size:12px">A couple other miscellaneous add-ons</span></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-size:12px">Hope you find something that moves you,<br>

P.S. I’ve got some more long drives ahead of me this week before I finally settle down in NY. I love listening to new stuff on road trips, so send me anything and everything you've been jamming to.&nbsp;</span>
