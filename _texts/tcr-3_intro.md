I’ve been living in NYC for about a month and am already in a deliriously fun honeymoon phase with this city. I’ve been having a blast, not getting enough sleep, and seeing some incredible live music. In the past week, I’ve seen <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4vAQ4M7vgItwBtmBTgRu48?si=UTK3uz_uTmWTH_dPRWDUvg" target="_blank" style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #007C89;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">Porridge Radio</a> (highlighted here last month) play one of the best shows I've seen in a long time, watched <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5IWCU0V9evBlW4gIeGY4zF?si=OlCaf_pFSh6lvIinemaRRg" target="_blank" style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #007C89;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">Waxahatchee</a> (a favorite of mine, who is putting out an album in October ) headline a festival in the mountains upstate NY, and on Wednesday I got to be in the crowd while my friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jeremyschmett/" target="_blank" style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #007C89;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">Jeremy Schmetterer</a>&nbsp;was onstage at a sweet venue, called Baby's All Right, in Brooklyn. New York is delivering the goods.<br>
<br>
On top of all of that, y’all have sent me some fantastic music that’s soundtracked my settling in to a new home. I’m grateful to be surrounded by all of this good music and energy, and am excited to share some of it back with y’all.<br>
<br>
One of the people who I’ve been swapping a bunch of music with is my friend Nicole Andrzejewski. While we were each at separate music festivals last weekend, we were trading notes. She was really into a folk trio she saw early in the day, and I invited her to write about them here. To go along with that, I'm sharing three artists I was loving this month below.<br>
