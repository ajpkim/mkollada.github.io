What's up good people,&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
I’ve been listening through a lot of different peoples’ 2022 favorites playlists over the last month and half. I find this annual practice of music heads engaging in personal curation, sharing and listening to be super rewarding. In making my own list, I get to relive all the music that excited me throughout the year and leave an artifact for my future self in the process. Sharing it and receiving friends lists in return is becoming tradition. It’s all I love about sharing music in a concentrated burst at the end of the year, with us connecting on the overlap and leaving with a bunch of new music to explore. This year I also was digging through playlists of more public people like music critics, publications, and even a favorite author from this year. There's something super warm about sharing the music we've been living with for the year. In the spirit, I've shared my end of year lists at the bottom.&nbsp;I'd love for you to send me yours if you happened to make one.<br>
<br>
This edition of The Collective Record playlist has that year-end curation and sharing in mind. I sent it out to those who had contributed in the past, and others I'd recently talked to about the newsletter, with the prompt “5-ish songs that somehow defined your 2022.” It’s awesome so far:
<ul>
<li style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1femCj7Bz44HB8XBgcuGe2?si=26900b8c76ab476c" target="_blank" style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #007C89;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">The Collective Record Playlist #5</a>

<ul>
<li style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">As always it's a Spotify collaborative playlist. Add 1,5 or however many songs that were a big part of your 2022!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Also my exquisitely-mustached friend Pete is here with an album. Pete has given tons of great music over the last 5 years, and this rec is no exception.&nbsp;<br>

Wishing you some good listening,<br>

P.S. I really like the way this playlist turned out. I’m going to keep sending it out beforehand for people to add to, with different prompts each time. If you want to be a part of that, just let me know and I’ll send it your way!
